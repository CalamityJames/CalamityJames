## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James, nice to meet you! If you've taken the time to land on my page, I guess I'd better tell you a bit about me.

- I've been coding websites since 1999, mainly in PHP (yes, I've even coded in PHP 3.x!)
- My daily driver nowadays is Laravel, but I also endure Magento for my sins.
- I also sysadmin our myriad of servers at work, keeping the wheels spinning for our clients.
- I waste my spare time coding Discord bots, mainly for the [redhotsonic](https://redhotsonic.com) and [Dankmus](https://dannkm.us) Discord servers.
- Outside of computers, I have an unhealthy obsession with [Nissans](https://www.calamityjames.co.uk/my-cars/tag/nissan) and have owned 18 of them.
- I enjoy trains, and have [contributed a couple of times](https://github.com/chrisys/train-departure-display) to a UK departure board repo.
- I also enjoy planes, and run my own ADS-B scanner that feeds into Flightradar, Flightaware and ADSBX.
